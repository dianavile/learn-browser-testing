## Learn Browser Testing

End to end testing and browser automation.

### Quick start

```sh
npm install
```

Then, `cd` into any directory and run:

```sh
npm start
```

### Windows users

If `npm start` works for you (try one of the cypress, or just examples), then continue with that - you don't need to change anything. Otherwise, run this to fix the error:

```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

Now, instead of running npm start, run:

```sh
yarn start
```
